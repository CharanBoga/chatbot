This repository contains the source code for a simple chatbot implemented in Python. The chatbot is designed to interact with users through text input and provide responses based on predefined patterns and rules.

## Features
- Responds to user input with predefined messages.
- Handles basic conversation flow.
- Easily extensible to add more responses and functionalities.

## Requirements

## Extending Functionality
To extend the functionality of the chatbot, you can:
- Modify the `responses.py` file to add more response patterns and corresponding replies.
- Implement more sophisticated natural language processing techniques or integrate with external APIs for more dynamic responses.
- Expand the conversation flow by updating the logic in `chatbot.py`.

Contributions to improve the chatbot are welcome. Here are some ways you can contribute:
- Report bugs or suggest enhancements by opening an issue.
- Submit pull requests with bug fixes, enhancements, or new features.

## Acknowledgements
